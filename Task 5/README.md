**Rustic Scraper**

Firstly I downloaded Rust packages and tried to extract it to vsc but it required c++ developer tools. Even after trying this I faced some errors. So I downloaded Intellj and installed rust extension and extracked the packages to it. Then I found some related sources in website. I couldn't make it into certain order but got the output. I couldn't add target folder due to space counsumption.
