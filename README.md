## Who'me?

I'm Jitin, from Bhimavaram,Andhrapradesh. My answer to why I joined Amrita is after screwing up Jee-Main I have only two options left CSE at VIT or ELC at Amrita. When I started to reasearch on quora I got to know about this club and joined in Amrita without any second thought. I don't have any coding experience neither I don't know much about computer. I started everything from scratch and learnt everything with the help of google and youtube.


## ABOUT MY TASKS

One of the most difficult tasks I have been assigned with in computer field. I have tried my level best to complete them but I couldn't.But I learnt how to approach new problems and languages and several ways to overcome errors. Whenever I thought "Oh God I couldn't complete more" some new ideas use to pop up in my mind.On a final note I would like to thank my mentors **Yash Khare** and **Soumi Chatterjee** for helping me in doing the tasks. I have done my level best in doing these tasks but it's up to you guys to select me or not. Also please excuse if there are any grammatical mistakes. 
**Thank You**
